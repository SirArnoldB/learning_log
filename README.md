# learning_log
> Learning Log allows users to log the topics they are interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. 
> The learning Log home page describes the site and invites users to either register or log in. 
> Once the user is logged in, they can create topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries

> Note: this project is based on the project in https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e by Eric Matthes. I have added additional functionality.
